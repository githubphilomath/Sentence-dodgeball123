SENTENCE DODGEBALL

Basic Details

Team Member: Mariena Thomas - VJCET

Project Description
Sentence Dodgeball is an interactive web game where words fall from the top of the screen, and the player must quickly click only the words of a specified type—either nouns or verbs. Players earn points for correctly catching target words while avoiding misses, with a win-or-lose pop-up at the end. It combines fun gameplay with basic natural language processing to classify words by their part of speech.


The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People spend hours trying to improve their grammar and vocabulary, but who has time to sit and study? Plus, traditional learning is boring and slow — what if catching falling words could teach parts of speech while having fun? Sentence Dodgeball solves the problem of “grammar learning boredom” by turning word classification into an addictive game.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We turned grammar practice into a fast-paced dodgeball game where words fall from the sky and you have to catch only the right ones — nouns or verbs — before they hit the ground! It’s like schooling meets arcade, with instant feedback and a scoreboard to boost your ego. Who said learning parts of speech can’t be a blast?
